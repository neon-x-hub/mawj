# ⚙️ Configuration

Once Mawj is running, you can configure basic settings from the web interface.

### 🧭 Accessing Settings

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/settings
```

From there, you can adjust:

* **🌐 Language** — Choose your preferred interface language (Arabic or English).
* **📁 Base Folder** — Select where Mawj should store your projects, templates, and renders.

---

### 💾 Notes

* This step is **optional** — if you skip it, Mawj will store all data inside the directory where your source code lives.
* After changing the **Base Folder**, you must **restart the server** for the new path to take effect.
